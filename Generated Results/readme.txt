Figure 1:
To get the figure1 , we plot analytical result where we try to implement the equation.
Here we get some error when we consider whole equation, so we neglect some part and try to plot again, then we get almost similar graphs as of the base  article.

Figure 2 and 3:
Here, both the figures are simila; by changing the parameters,we get both the figures.

Figure 4:
While Ploting this figure,we get some misbehaviour of curve beyond certain values, so we restrict the figure for some values only.

Figure 5:
We plot the analytical result for figure 5.
